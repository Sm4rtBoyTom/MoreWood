**MoreWood**

Do you like even more useless items? then this mod is just for you!
Birch Wood can be found in birch forests and oak can be found near oak trees.
Both wood types have a Pile version made by combining 5 pieces of respected firewood.
Birch is more similiar to cedar and oak to fir.

**Attention!** Wood does not respawn, and yes it's intended i wanted it to be more rare plus i don't want to spend time learning how to Code
instead of actually playing the game. If anyone would be interested to add this function it would be more than welcome!
